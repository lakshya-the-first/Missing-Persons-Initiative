# Missing-Persons-Initiative
High level: 

  This was a hackathon project that my team and I created at StarterHacks in Jan 2020. This project was build for Toronto Police Services and other emergency services in the         Greater Toronto Area. Its purpose was to help minimize the 911 caller traffic during times of crisis by allowing the public to submit missing person reports online and helping     emergency services identify individuals that they find. 

Technology used:

   This project was coded in C++ to illustrate the back-end of project. This was the first hackathon that my group and I were attending and as a result, we realized that creating    both a back-end and front-end solution would be unrealistic. We decided to focus on the back-end since if the back-end missing persons matching system didn't work, then the        purpose of the project wouldn't be fulfilled. 

How it worked:

  A text file represented the information that would be inputted by emergency services (ES). This included physical traits such as skin complexion, height, and any identification found (first name, last name). The user would input information about the missing person they want to report. The information they'd provide is the missing person's name, height, skin complexion, and their own contact information should a potential match occur. The user's input would then be cross referenced with the emergency services' input (text file) and if a match occurred, the system would provide ES with the contact information of the family/friend who filled out the report. This would minimize the number of phone calls that 911 operators receive while allowing family and friends to be able to locate their loved ones.
